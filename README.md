# EXMO 2023 EscapeRoom Interface

This is a simple Electron app that I built for an Escape Room event at EXMO 2023. The application is designed to run on two screens. One screen displays the countdown timer for the game, while the other screen features the main interface that players will use to interact and solve puzzles. It also connected with an arduino board that controlled the lighting inside the room.
